# Summernote WYSIWYG for Business Central
One of the frequent requests I hear from users is the WYSIWYG editor. Unfortunately, Microsoft has not added the editor yet. So I decided to integrate some free editor into Business Central. My choice was summernote, a simple and functional WYSIWYG editor. I will also talk about new app updates.
